  "instructions": "You have been asked to participate in an economics experiment. For your participation today we will pay you $3 in cash at the end of the experiment. After the proposal forms have been returned to Room A each person will be paid. Each person will receive $3 for participating in this experiment. In this experiment each of you will be paired with a different person who is in another room. You will not be told who these people are either during or after the experiment, and they will not be told who you are. A sum of $5 has been provisionally allocated to each pair and the person in Room A can propose how much of this each person is to receive. To do this, the person in Room A must fill out a form titled 'Proposal Form'. The person in Room A makes the proposal. The proposal consists of an amount the person in Room B is to receive. The amount the person in Room A is to receive is simply the total amount to be divided minus the amount the person in Room B is to receive. ",
