      "Subjects played a series of 40 one-shot games, including Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) games against different opponents.",
      "PD games were presented in triads consisting of three versions: opponent strategy unknown, opponent known to have competed, and opponent known to have cooperated.",
      "PD games were interspersed with other two-person games to prevent the development of standard strategies.",
      "Subjects participated in a version of Newcomb's problem involving two boxes (A and B) and a computer program that predicted their choice with 92% success.",
      "Subjects chose between taking both Box A and Box B or taking only Box B.",
      "A separate group of subjects played PD games and were offered the opportunity to pay a small fee to learn the opponent's decision before making their own choice."
