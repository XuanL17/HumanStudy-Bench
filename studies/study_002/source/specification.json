      "A calibration group provides numerical estimates and confidence ratings for 15 uncertain quantities.",

      "Experimental participants are presented with a quantity and a specified anchor (high or low).",
      "Participants judge whether the true value of the quantity is higher or lower than the specified anchor.",
      "Participants provide a numerical estimate for the quantity.",
      "Participants rate their confidence in their estimate on a 10-point scale.",
      "In a replication study (Exp 2), a manipulation is added to discredit the informational value of the anchor.",
      "In a public goods study (Exp 3), participants perform a dichotomous judgment (referendum) before providing a numerical Willingness to Pay (WTP) estimate."
