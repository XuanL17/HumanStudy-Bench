  "instructions": "Consider the following game: a large number of players have to state simultaneously a number in the closed interval [0, 100]. The winner is the person whose chosen number is closest to the mean of all chosen numbers multiplied by a parameter p, where p = 1/2. The payoff to the winner is a fixed amount (20 DM). If there is a tie, the prize is divided equally among the winners. The other players whose chosen numbers are further away receive nothing. The game is played for four rounds by the same group of players. After each round, all chosen numbers, the mean, p times the mean, the winning numbers, and the payoffs are presented to the subjects.",
